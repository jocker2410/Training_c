Hey there! 👋 I'm on a coding journey, and I'm thrilled to share it with you. Currently, I'm diving into the fantastic world of C programming and working through exercises from the book:

📘 Title: "A TUTORIAL INTRODUCTION"
📖 Chapter 1: Let's Get Started!

In this chapter, we're taking a hands-on approach to learn the essentials of C. No need to drown in details or get lost in formal rules! 🏊 Our goal is simple: equip you with the basics—variables, constants, arithmetic, control flow, functions, and a sprinkle of input/output magic. We're keeping it light and fun! 🎉

## 🚧 Warning: ##
We're intentionally skipping some heavy C features like pointers, structures, and a bunch of operators. Fear not! It's for a good cause—getting you to write cool programs ASAP. 😎 But don't worry, we'll circle back to those later chapters. Repetition might happen, but trust me, it's for your benefit, not to annoy you! 🔄

## 🚦 What's in the README? ##

1.	Project Focus: Learning C programming and sharing the journey.
2.	Current Chapter: Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction.
3.	Book Link: Chapter 2 and beyond for the nitty-gritty details.
